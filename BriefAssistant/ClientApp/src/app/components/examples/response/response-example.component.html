          <b>What is a Respondent's Response Brief?</b>
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Respondent is the party who won in the circuit court (also called the trial court) and who wants the Court of Appeals to affirm all or part of the circuit court’s decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Response Brief is a formal document filed by the Respondent. It addresses the issues and arguments presented in the Appellant’s Initial Brief, and it explains why the circuit court decided your case correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Response Brief presents the facts of the case, describes the circuit court’s decision, cites to legal authorities such as statutes and case law, and explains why the arguments presented in the Appellant’s Initial Brief are wrong—meaning, not supported by the law and/or the facts.
