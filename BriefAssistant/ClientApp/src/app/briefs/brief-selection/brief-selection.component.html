  Generally, there are two parties to an appeal: the Appellant and the Respondent.
  The Appellant is the party who believes that the circuit court decided all or part of his case incorrectly.
  The Respondent is the party who believes that the circuit court decided the case correctly.

          In an appeal, the Appellant files two types of briefs.
          The first brief the Appellant must file is called an Initial Brief, which explains the case and the mistakes that the circuit court made.

          The Respondent files only a Response Brief, which as its name suggests, responds to the Appellantâ€™s Initial Brief and explains why the circuit court decided the case correctly.
