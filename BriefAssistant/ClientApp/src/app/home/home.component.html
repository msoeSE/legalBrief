  <p>
    The Brief Assistant does NOT provide legal advice. The Appellate Practice Section strongly urges parties to an appeal to retain a lawyer to represent them. Sometimes that is not possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if you have filed a <b>civil</b> appeal and you cannot afford a lawyer, you may wish to visit the <a href="https://www.wisbar.org/forPublic/INeedaLawyer/AppellateHelpDesk/Pages/Appellate-Help-Desk.aspx" target="_blank"><u>Appellate Help Desk</u></a>
    for advice on how to prepare your brief.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have filed a <b>criminal</b> appeal and you cannot afford a lawyer, you may be eligible for one through the Wisconsin State Public Defender. For criminal appeals in Milwaukee, call
