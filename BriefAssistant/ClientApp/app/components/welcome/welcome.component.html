            <b>Disclaimer:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Brief Assistant does NOT provide legal advice. The Appellate Practice Section strongly urges parties to an appeal to retain a lawyer to represent them. Sometimes that is not possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if you have filed a civil appeal and you cannot afford a lawyer, you may wish to call, text, or email the Appellate Help Desk at 414-671-9041 or
            <a href="mailto:appellatehelp@gmail.com" target="_top">appellatehelp@gmail.com</a>
            for advice on how to prepare your brief.
